# volume-manager
Chrome Extension to control and boost volume of any Tab

This is a fork of Vadagon's Volume Manager extension for chrome, that redacts unwanted "features" like the chrome://newtab override, integrated Google Analytics, and external website options panel.

I won't be publishing this extension, as to avoid confusion with the original one.
